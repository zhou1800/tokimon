# AI Entry Point (Start Here)

Start sequence (every chat turn):
1) Read `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2) Read `docs/helix.md` — the canonical method and operating instructions.
3) Read `docs/repository-guidelines.md` — repo-specific commands and conventions.

Non-negotiables
- All method rules, principles, and the 4-step loop are defined in `docs/helix.md`.
- All repo-specific conventions (build commands, testing, commit format) are in `docs/repository-guidelines.md`.
- This file only defines reading order.
